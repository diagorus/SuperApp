# Shared module specific build outputs (mostly covered by root)
/build/

# If you have specific generated files within the shared module
# that aren't under build/ or are for specific targets
# e.g.
# /generated/ios/
# /generated/js/
# However, KMP usually places these under the shared/build/ directory.
